#Mammals are vertebrates within the class Mammalia which have a neocortex 
#(i.e., higher brain functions), hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands.


#Birds are a collection of warm-blooded vertebrates within the class Aves, 
#identified by feathers, toothless, beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a four-chambered heart, and a well-built yet lightweight skeleton system.

#Reptiles are four-limbed (aka tetrapod) animals within the class Reptilia

#Amphibians are cold-blooded, four-limbed vertebrates within the class Amphibia.

#Fishes are the aquatic animals within the class Anatidae that do not have limbs with digits.

#Above are Animal types (_ofType) and their class (_class)

#With the exception of the Animal (abstract) class, add specific features (properties or attributes) 
#to each class that are distinct only to the Animal specie / class,
#this can be done by abstraction by inheritance or by interface.


#Declare a list of Animals - and add 2 species of each per (sub)class
#Example:
#           Lion & Dog are mammals - create a Lion class and Dog class
#           Parrot & Penguin are Birds - create a Parrot and Penguin class

#Loop through all the items in the list
#Print all the name of Fishes, Mammal and Birds only using INTERFACE

#Check also each class as there are certain TODO(s) that will help you accomplish the task
#Once done commit and push to your own account in Github
